## Technical considerations.

![[Pasted image 20260203154802.png]]

### **General Perspective**
1) Onboarding process and UX (NWC - LNURL - Cashu) * new Hand sake possibilities with latest NIP or LN improvements* [[Bolt12]]
2) UX of proposal
3) Onboarding, recycling (next event/or online) and storing.

### **Relay Perspective**
#### Studio
1) Landing the Studio onto robust working protocols - Firmly connecting nostr + Wallet.
2) Proper Audio Handling - Blossom (Documentation - about why and how)
3) Karthu validation
4) Now we are focused on a Publishing Relay (Recording Studio/Label)
5) Relay Selection
#### Radio
Define broadcasting ID as they will be paying (or voluntary payment?)
- Relay 
	- Serving music (earning as relay/wholesaler)
	- Paying as broadcaster
	- Funded - BTC to stake LN
- UX of this relay (to be thought + )
	- Relay selection (What we gossip)
	- Player
	- Curating
	- Relay with sub-relays - for curation (programs)
		- Interaction - Radio and Online Player would be the same.
			- Zaps on the online stream are also feeding the radio.
	- MulitID for different programs? Or just a RadioID with tags
		- For curation the "sub-relays"
		- For agency - sub-accounts?
	- Publishing of playlists (automatically created)
	- Full admin of the system
		- Creation of accounts and the access to the wallets


Question mark - how playlist curators would interact - 

### **Client Perspective**
#### Fans Players
1) Agreed core compoenents  - Wallet/ID/Player/Assets (tickets, songs)/Chat/DM?
2) Feed on the Player
3) Vault - Seed for ID and wallet (recovery pattern - encryption) --> Signing capacity.
	1) With this approach even the tickets are directly linked. 
4) Joint Strategy (onboarding + carrying) - The Personal APP + Use case Broadcasting app. 
	1) If it is also a sats onboarding strategy, maybe the need for an external wallet (ouside of the master seed). "You come, top-up, use, and keep for next time (physical), also keep for online [same wallet or not]", but you can also send out (Fedimint).
	2) 
5) Overall UX - Side Panel. 
	1) Prominence Player first vs wallet first vs event first.
6) Multi IDs - possible crosses with wallets 
7) Creation partter - master seed to ID, to Wallets (separate seeds for each of them?) do we need the 12 words for entropy. 
	1) What level you anchor the IDs (ppp level or at a entropy level) - encypted-PulbicPrivatePair to enter, then subaccounts at entropy level with 12 words. At master seed as well.
		1) Disposable wallet - finger patter 
8) Relay selection - Mapping of relays.


### **Joint Solutions - requiring client and relay**
### Festival/Club
- Full bar economy - Menu/Prices . Merchandise.
	- Ticketing.
- Program
	- Music content of the event
		- Artists
		- Playlists
	- Timing
- Event Feed
- What payment rails (BitcoinPay?)
- Jukebox 4 bars?
- Proximity chat? Bit-chat?
- On app synch activities (example - auctions with a target account)
